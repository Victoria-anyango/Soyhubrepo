      <h2 class="section-title">Soybean Planting</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          Soybeans are typically planted in the spring when soil temperatures reach around 50°F (10°C). The seeds are sown at a depth of 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) and spaced about 2 to 6 inches (5 to 15 cm) apart, depending on the variety and desired yield.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to prepare the soil by removing weeds and ensuring good drainage. Soybeans require full sun and well-drained soil for optimal growth. Adequate moisture is also crucial during the germination and early growth stages.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Weeding</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          Weeding is essential to maintain healthy soybean plants. It's important to remove weeds that compete for nutrients, water, and sunlight. Frequent weeding early in the growing season is recommended to minimize competition and ensure optimal soybean growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mulching around the soybean plants can also help suppress weed growth and conserve moisture in the soil. Mechanical or chemical weed control methods may be used, but it's important to follow proper guidelines and avoid damage to the soybean plants.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Harvesting</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          Soybeans are typically ready for harvest when the leaves begin to turn yellow and the pods have reached maturity. This usually occurs around 90 to 150 days after planting, depending on the variety and growing conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harvesting can be done using combine harvesters, which remove the beans from the plants and separate them from the pods. After harvesting, the soybeans are typically dried to reduce moisture content and prevent spoilage.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Storage</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          Proper storage is important to maintain the quality of harvested soybeans. The beans should be stored in clean, dry, and well-ventilated containers or silos. Moisture content should be kept below 12% to prevent mold growth and spoilage.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also important to protect the soybeans from pests, such as rodents and insects. Regular inspection and monitoring of stored soybeans can help identify any issues early on and prevent losses.
